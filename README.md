# Arb Translator

It is an extension program that translates [ARB(Application Resource Bundle)](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle/wiki/ApplicationResourceBundleSpecification) files to Google Translator.

## Features
- Use Google Translator to translate arb files. (if the key contains `@`, it will not be translated.)
- Translate only newly added or changed keys from the source file.

## Requirements

Since this extension program uses Google Translator, please refer to the [link](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/setup) and proceed with the API setting and API Key issuance process.
